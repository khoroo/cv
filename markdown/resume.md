Experience
----------

#### Data Annotation<br>*Jan 2024 - Present*

* Trained AI models in programming skills through direct interactions and code analysis
* Provided detailed feedback on AI performance and rewrote code when necessary
* Analysed Python programs, including AST-based entropy calculations
* Utilised Nix to test code across multiple programming languages

#### Gousto<br>Data Scientist London, UK, *Jan 2021 - Jul 2022*

* Developed two data products in small team, researching, supporting engineers to bring into production, and building data pipelines for analysts using PySpark and Databricks.
* Applied queuing theory and statistics to answer questions posed by stakeholders on future factory quality assurance throughput and the risk posed by traffic for stock transfer.
* Took responsibility for enabling simulation of a new factory in-house, utilising the tool to analyse the necessary algorithm iterations and inform decision making when scaling the business.
* Simulated entire supply chain, analysed results and presented to stakeholders to enable informed decisions on key business objective of menu scaling.
* Collaborated with Data Scientists from other teams during side project time to ensure simulated orders had the same distribution as the aggregate forecast.
* A product allocating orders to factories, reducing delivery costs.
* A product allocating ingredients to factories, increasing peak capacity.

#### Wriggle<br>Data Scientist Bristol, UK, *Jun 2019 - Jan 2020*

* Investigated referral scheme, uncovered thousands of pounds of fraud, prompting an overhaul of marketing strategy.
* Leveraged analytics to drive business development and marketing strategies including customer lifetime modelling, acquisition, retention and win backs.

#### University of Bristol<br>Teaching Assistant Bristol, UK, *Jan 2018 - May 2020*

* Supported students learning introductory and further programming in Python and C in a lab environment.
